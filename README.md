#### Description: A single-page web application serving as a mailbox using JavaScript to handle content client-side
#### Command: python manage.py runserver

This is a project submitted as part of Havard University's CS50w online course. 

This web-based application is structured using a single-page in Django, using both Python and JavaScript to manipulate the content on screen. Users have the ability to send and receive emails to and from other users, move between various mailboxes, and archive or unarchive emails as needed. The reply function also allows users to draft new emails, with input fields prepopulated as needed.
